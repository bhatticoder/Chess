# Importing the Pygame library and relevant modules
import pygame as pg  # Import Pygame and give it an alias "pg" for convenience
from pygame.locals import *  # Import all Pygame constants like QUIT

# Initialize Pygame
pg.init()  # This initializes all Pygame modules required for the game (graphics, sounds, etc.)

# Create a game window (screen)
screen = pg.display.set_mode((640, 480))  
# This creates a window of size 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high.
# The "screen" object represents the display surface where everything will be drawn.

# Set the title of the game window
pg.display.set_caption("Pygame Test")  
# This sets the title of the window to "Pygame Test" which appears in the title bar.

# Main game loop (infinite loop)
while True:  
    # This loop runs continuously until the game is closed.
    
    # Handle events (such as key presses, mouse clicks, etc.)
    for event in pg.event.get():  
        # This retrieves all the events that Pygame has detected (e.g., closing the window).
        
        if event.type == QUIT:  
            # If the user clicks the close button (X), the event type will be QUIT.

            pg.quit()  # This uninitializes Pygame, properly closing the game window.
            exit()  # This exits the program to stop execution.

    # Update the display to reflect any changes
    pg.display.update()  
    # This refreshes the screen, making sure any updates (drawings, movements, etc.) appear.
